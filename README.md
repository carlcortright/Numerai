# Numerai

> Machine learning models for the Numerai stock trading competition written in Julia

## Goal

The goal of this project is to combine Julia, a fast, modern, dynamically typed programming language, with current machine learning methods to play the Numerai stock trading competition. The idea behind Numerai is to use a very small subset of encrypted stock data along with advanced machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to create better stock trading algorithms. It is licensed under the MIT license because it is mostly just an exercise in Julia an binary classification.
